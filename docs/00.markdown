Booklet
=======

*Booklet* is a publishing software for short texts, particularly user documentation. It is designed to be easy to write and read on any platform.
*Booklet* is a fork of [Pamflet][pf] by Nathan Hamblen and others. Before use *Booklet* please read [Pamflet documentation][pd]. Most things that work
in [Pamflet][pf] work in *Booklet* too.

Features of Booklet:

* hardcoded template moved on [Scalate][sl];
* ability to use markdown inside HTML blocks;
* options are merged from different levels: per documentation, per page, user specific;
* reevaluate environment from the beginning for every publication. *From the one side this is much slower than caching. From the other one - any changes are applied immediately, which is important for end user while design stage. Also realtime parameter isn't a primary one for a such type of text generators. It works like a charm with [compass watch][cw] and interactive development.*

This documentation is created with Booklet. Such result is a hardly available with hardcoded template. Scalate gave it a new breath of life.
