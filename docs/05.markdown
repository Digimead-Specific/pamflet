Options
=======

There are several booklet options that affect the result. From the user point of view the options is a map of *key -> value* pairs. These pairs are held by [Properties][pr]. There are few sources of options:

* file booklet.properties in markdown catalog (the lowest priority)
* properties that is [emmedded into a markdown][embed]
* user specified properties (the highest priority)

While processing all options are merged and [converted][cv] to [Scalate attributes][sc].

You may add your own options as well.
